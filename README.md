# DeepRANSProject
**Description**: A project solving the RANS equation for 1D channel flow using neural networks, for different closure models. \
**Methodology**: Uses the *NeuroDiffEq* library, applying it to the RANS by implementing a mixed boundary value problem. \
**Closure models**: Prandtl mixing length, Van Driest mixing length, Rui FCNN and Ocariz CNN.
